/**
 * A header for a checkpoint on the Sui blockchain.
 *
 * On the Sui network, checkpoints define the history of the blockchain. They are quite similar to
 * the concept of blocks used by other blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The Sui blockchain,
 * however, forms checkpoints after transaction execution has already happened to provide a
 * certified history of the chain, instead of being formed before execution.
 *
 * Checkpoints commit to a variety of state, including but not limited to:
 * - The hash of the previous checkpoint.
 * - The set of transaction digests, their corresponding effects digests, as well as the set of
 *   user signatures that authorized its execution.
 * - The objects produced by a transaction.
 * - The set of live objects that make up the current state of the chain.
 * - On epoch transitions, the next validator committee.
 *
 * `CheckpointSummary`s themselves don't directly include all of the previous information but they
 * are the top-level type by which all the information is committed to transitively via cryptographic
 * hashes included in the summary. `CheckpointSummary`s are signed and certified by a quorum of
 * the validator committee in a given epoch to allow verification of the chain's state.
